This library should take over where madFile and easyio have dropped off.


Extra stuff like compressing/encrypting are added using Decorator pattern.
Need a co-existing interface to Open damn streams in modes: read, write, append, seek (think on it).
Seekability will be important for Serial/HTTP Sources/Sinks...
Peeking into stream would be useful (?? never used that since many years)


Archive support.
HTTP/FTP/other network support.
Console support.
Temporary source/sink support (uhm?).
